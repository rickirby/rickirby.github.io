### Technology Behind the Apps
#### Mono-Repo Modular with Development Pods
I map every page in my app and breakdown its dependency. As a result, I get these dependency graph which is separated into 3-level of modularization.

#### Dependency Injection
I solve the inter-dependency needs by using `Dependency Injection`. This approach can avoid the import of other internal framework with the same level, otherwise it can lead to circular dependency.

#### Core Data with CloudKit Sync
I implement `CoreData` to save page-scanner result, then sync the storage to the userâ€™s personal iCloud. As result, user still can see their scanned page on other iOS device if theyâ€™re log in with the same iCloud account.
